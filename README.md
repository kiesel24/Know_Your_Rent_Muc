First of all, the data is needed. Therefore a web scraping algorithm will be programmed. 

After that the data need to be processed. With the processing data a machine learning algorithm will be feeded. 

Finally everything will be deployed for everybody on a website. The presented alogrithm will implemented in a cloud architecture.
